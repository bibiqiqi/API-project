# Eat The Weeds
This application was designed as a tool to encourage more natural literacy in people by highlighting the cultural connections (food, medicinal, tools etc) that exist in the plants, fungi, and trees around us. I've started with highlighting the edible values of common weeds, and plan to expand on this. Once the user picks an edible weed by image, they can input their location's address to see how many observations of this plant have been sited and posted to the app iNaturalist, by their users.

## Disclaimer
It's important to note that identifying a plant is not always 100% accurate, and some plants have poisonous look-a-likes, so caution should be used before ingesting any kind of wild plants. This is not meant to be used as a guide for the amateur forager to rely on, but rather a tool in retraining how we view our natural surroundings.
